Chronic sialadenitis is usually secondary to sialolithiasis (salivary  stone). Sialadenitis Refers to inflammation of a salivary gland and may be acute or chronic. Acute sialadenitis Acute sialadenitis is an acute inflammation of a salivary gland. Patients typically present  acutely in A and E with erythema over the area, pain, tenderness upon palpation, and  swelling. The infection is often the result of dehydration with overgrowth of the oral flora.  A common scenario would be postoperative dehydration. Purulent material may be  observed. Chronic sialadenitis Chronic sialadenitis, in contrast, is typically less painful and is associated with recurrent  enlargement of the gland (often following meals) typically without erythema. The chronic  form of the disease is associated with conditions linked to decreased salivary flow,  rather than dehydration. These conditions include calculi (sialolithiasis).", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.803561", "id": "992083dd-4a05-4045-9fa9-30e279b1db21"}, "Option.849e2e86-80b7-40ff-bb29-fc515c80458a": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "882f336a-2453-47ca-884c-0619b81b18fc", "option": "A", "valid": "T", "text": "Chronic sialadenitis", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.804368", "id": "849e2e86-80b7-40ff-bb29-fc515c80458a"}, "Option.fb98ea59-770c-4291-a510-f77857dffbfe": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "882f336a-2453-47ca-884c-0619b81b18fc", "option": "B", "valid": "F", "text": "Adenolymphoma", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.805987", "id": "fb98ea59-770c-4291-a510-f77857dffbfe"}, "Option.cf894c46-10b4-4792-9234-3429e8f0b8ad": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "882f336a-2453-47ca-884c-0619b81b18fc", "option": "C", "valid": "F", "text": "Mikulicz\u2019s disease", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.806823", "id": "cf894c46-10b4-4792-9234-3429e8f0b8ad"}, "Option.dd5ba9ab-a091-4fba-a98a-7a37594ef03b": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "882f336a-2453-47ca-884c-0619b81b18fc", "option": "D", "valid": "F", "text": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.807681", "id": "dd5ba9ab-a091-4fba-a98a-7a37594ef03b"}, "Option.e75e0895-717f-44ea-8ef4-25e41c2499f2": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "882f336a-2453-47ca-884c-0619b81b18fc", "option": "E", "valid": "F", "text": "Salivary gland neoplasm", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.808679", "id": "e75e0895-717f-44ea-8ef4-25e41c2499f2"}, "Question.ad3bb733-8f0b-42e1-a406-9054c401ffbb": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "course": "PLAB", "type": "SBA", "text": "A 45 year old man presents with progressive hoarseness.

Cohort studies are observational. They evaluate the natural history of a condition.  Patients are divided into specific groups basedon their exposure characteristics and  followed up over a period of time to determine if the outcome or diseae of interest  develops. The distractor here is a case-control study. Case-control studies are retrospective.  They look at two groups at the start: one with the outcome or disese and one without  the outcome or disease. They look retrospectively (back in the past) to assess if there  was a significant difference in the rates of exposure to a definedr isk ffactor between the  groups. CLINICAL STUDIES Case series and case reports. These are reports of cases and use no control groups  or patient groups to compare outcomes. They are similar to writing a report on a topic  that you have read. Case-control study. This is a study in which patients who already have a specific  condition are compared with people who do not have that particular condition. These  study designs are observational, meaning that researches study but do not alter what  occurs. They look retrospectively (back in the past) to assess if there was a significant  difference in the rates of exposure to a defined risk factor between the groups.  Example, group A consist of patients with lung cancer and group B consists of patients  without lung cancer. Information is collected looking back at their smoking history. The  hypothesis would be that smoking would incur a higher risk of lung cancer. Cohort study. These studies identify a group of people who share a defining  characteristic. This group is then compared with a similar group of people with the  same defining characteristic. Cohort studies are purely observational and may be  prospective (going forward in time) or retrospective (happened in the past). Because  these studies are observational, the researchers (like in case-control studies) do not  intervene with the groups of people. Example of a prospective cohort study, group A  are patients who smoke, group B are patients who do not smoke. They are followed in  time to determine who develops lung cancer. What is the difference between a case-control study and a retrospective cohort study? In case-control, one starts with the outcomes andstudies the exposure. In retrospective  cohort studies, one already has determined the exposure, but now needs to study the  association of exposure to disease outcome. Randomised controlled clinical trial. These are experiments that introduce a  treatment or exposure to study its effect on real patients. It usually compares an active  group with a control group and employs methods such as randomisation and blinding toreduce bias. Typically, new drugs are tested this way. Example, a group of patients  with disease X who meet specific criteria, are randomly allocated to receive either the  experimental treatment or the control treatment (either the standard treatement for  disease X or a placebo). Both groups are then followed in time, and the outcomes are  observed. Cross-sectional study. This is a study that describes the relationship between  diseases and other factors at one point in time in a defined population. They are often  used for comparing diagnostic tests. A good example would be researches performing  a survey on a population to detemine the relationship between increased levels of  serum cholesterol and electrocardiographic evidence of coronary artery disease. Both  the exposure and the disease outcome are taken at the same point of time. It is like a  snapshot of a population at a specific time. Systemic review. This focuses on a clinical topic and answers a specific question that  arises. Meta-analysis. This is a study that examines a number of studies on a topic and  mathematically combines the results to report the results as if it were one large study.", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.873303", "id": "c2b0d4cf-02ed-41da-bdec-ee5b37397635"}, "Option.341fcafc-441e-4a23-aab4-dc8c354e6615": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "881d3ca3-be8e-489b-a0b5-4dd328586650", "option": "A", "valid": "T", "text": "Prospective cohort study", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.879209", "id": "341fcafc-441e-4a23-aab4-dc8c354e6615"}, "Option.c4a5f419-d8e0-4dc8-8e4d-904aeba670d0": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "881d3ca3-be8e-489b-a0b5-4dd328586650", "option": "B", "valid": "F", "text": "Restroscpective cohort study", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.887045", "id": "c4a5f419-d8e0-4dc8-8e4d-904aeba670d0"}, "Option.5f1e2a3c-7f66-4914-92ed-898ac0d8f3ac": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "881d3ca3-be8e-489b-a0b5-4dd328586650", "option": "C", "valid": "F", "text": "Case-control study", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.889904", "id": "5f1e2a3c-7f66-4914-92ed-898ac0d8f3ac"}, "Option.7a41b732-926b-4417-b8dd-da8ba7cc19bf": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "881d3ca3-be8e-489b-a0b5-4dd328586650", "option": "D", "valid": "F", "text": "Randomized controlled study", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.900652", "id": "7a41b732-926b-4417-b8dd-da8ba7cc19bf"}, "Option.985b002d-11b9-47d9-bca8-c28a433cf4ff": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "881d3ca3-be8e-489b-a0b5-4dd328586650", "option": "E", "valid": "F", "text": "Prevalence", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.903827", "id": "985b002d-11b9-47d9-bca8-c28a433cf4ff"}, "Question.b4b55f51-3c1f-4e6e-81a4-5288b52f1d41": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "course": "PLAB", "type": "SBA", "text": "10000 women underwent a newly developed cervical smear screen. 1000 of them  had a smear result which shows premalignant changes and had further  investigations and biopsies.

The easiest way to remember this is using the following definitions.True positive is the amount of sick people correctly identified as sick False positives is the amount of healthy people incorrectly identified as sick True negative is the healthy people correctly identified as healthy False negative is the sick people incorrectly identified as healthy High sensitivity means few false negatives Low sensitivity means many false negatives High specificity means few false positives Low specificity means many false positives Mnemonic: SeNsitivity \u2013 Look at false Negatives Specificity \u2013 Look at false Positives", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.917752", "id": "3299b4c4-bbe3-44b1-a501-2d38fb2f30e6"}, "Option.30dfbef4-2743-4daf-b1f3-c0514ae58425": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b4b55f51-3c1f-4e6e-81a4-5288b52f1d41", "option": "A", "valid": "F", "text": "High true positive rate", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.925538", "id": "30dfbef4-2743-4daf-b1f3-c0514ae58425"}, "Option.a3508ee6-b846-4156-b1df-fd90f83ab9db": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b4b55f51-3c1f-4e6e-81a4-5288b52f1d41", "option": "B", "valid": "F", "text": "High true negative rate", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.934040", "id": "a3508ee6-b846-4156-b1df-fd90f83ab9db"}, "Option.206fd3fb-d8da-4ccc-9c88-51413c588e69": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b4b55f51-3c1f-4e6e-81a4-5288b52f1d41", "option": "C", "valid": "F", "text": "High false negative rate", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.946738", "id": "206fd3fb-d8da-4ccc-9c88-51413c588e69"}, "Option.ee8a782d-553e-4fb7-89bb-e7baeb08b478": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b4b55f51-3c1f-4e6e-81a4-5288b52f1d41", "option": "D", "valid": "T", "text": "Low specificity", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.954656", "id": "ee8a782d-553e-4fb7-89bb-e7baeb08b478"}, "Option.80879687-1898-46e1-8f96-ab297bf3ccad": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b4b55f51-3c1f-4e6e-81a4-5288b52f1d41", "option": "E", "valid": "F", "text": "Low sensitivity", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:48.959674", "id": "80879687-1898-46e1-8f96-ab297bf3ccad"}, "Question.7e3a5135-b9c5-4c13-8074-280d2af81c5a": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "course": "PLAB", "type": "SBA", "text": "A random study on pulmonary embolism shows 10 patients out of 100 died who  did not get treatment and 10 patients out of 100 died who got proper treatment.

Failure of the active drug is incorrect seeing as how a more significant percentage of the  placebo group withdrew. Insufficient information to interpret data occurs when researchers do not have sufficient  results to analyse the study.Chance even in this context means that a specific cause cannot explain the people\u2019s  withdrawal i.e. the dropout was by chance. The issue with this statement is the massive  discrepancy in dropouts of the placebo group compared to the experimental group. An  acceptable dropout rate between groups is considered to be less than 15%. Here we  see a drop out rate difference of 22%. Furthermore, we would expect a dropout rate to  be small given that the study is only for one year. A study of 10 years may have a  dropout rate difference of 20% to 25% which is acceptable because patients are often  lost to follow up as it is such a lengthy study. Dropouts not related to systemic bias  could occur due to an unrelated illness, death, or job relocation. That being said, a  study that only lasts for one year should have dropout rates that are near to zero for it to  be considered a chance event. An initial randomisation error is a possibility although the stem gives no information as  to how the patients were selected. If methodologies were not appropriate, it could lead  to bias and compromise the study. The best answer is that there is a breakdown of the double-blind study. A breakdown in  the study can occur if people from either group find out that they are in the experimental  group or the control group. Patients in the placebo group may have found that they  have been taking placebo medication and hence decided to leave. This would result in  a very high percentage of people in the placebo group leaving which is precisely what  we see in this case.", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:49.066558", "id": "1cf2e327-2321-4bc7-86c1-2d165e2e0eb0"}, "Option.77a15e33-730c-4426-852b-d60d459c299e": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b31bba4d-5e89-4642-b7b5-6f47d98ef645", "option": "A", "valid": "F", "text": "Chance event", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:49.077446", "id": "77a15e33-730c-4426-852b-d60d459c299e"}, "Option.25e0bab6-7c87-4eda-95a3-2cc1474e0469": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b31bba4d-5e89-4642-b7b5-6f47d98ef645", "option": "B", "valid": "T", "text": "Breakdown of the double-blind study", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:49.089165", "id": "25e0bab6-7c87-4eda-95a3-2cc1474e0469"}, "Option.e06fb068-6d50-4834-8e84-641e93dd6f4b": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b31bba4d-5e89-4642-b7b5-6f47d98ef645", "option": "C", "valid": "F", "text": "Failure of the active drug", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:49.098389", "id": "e06fb068-6d50-4834-8e84-641e93dd6f4b"}, "Option.b7663270-7668-43e2-bfbd-63e17dd76ef6": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b31bba4d-5e89-4642-b7b5-6f47d98ef645", "option": "D", "valid": "F", "text": "Insufficient information to interpret data", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:49.107313", "id": "b7663270-7668-43e2-bfbd-63e17dd76ef6"}, "Option.ec5d4314-5e46-4aff-8881-ab27f66eaf5f": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "question_id": "b31bba4d-5e89-4642-b7b5-6f47d98ef645", "option": "E", "valid": "F", "text": "An initial randomisation error.", "updated_at": "2024-04-01T23:57:49.112993", "id": "ec5d4314-5e46-4aff-8881-ab27f66eaf5f"}, "Question.1d002f17-acdf-44a4-8ec7-1fe97ef0299d": {"user_id": "205e0f59-71a1-474b-a3c2-c62877031607", "course": "PLAB", "type": "SBA", "text": "Two groups of women with osteoporosis were recruited to be involved in a study.
